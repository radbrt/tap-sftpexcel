  - spikes/ftps/connect.py
    - Works to connect to the ftp server
    - Does NOT work on commands that require opening a second connection
      - This is why some commands are working and some are not
      - docker run -p 30000-30100:30000-30100 ftps
        - This command resolves the issue of running the ftp commands
        - The important part being ~-p 30000-30100:30000-30100~
  - [1/1] QUESTIONS:
    - [X] How can we get the FTP_TLS object to run commands that require a second port?
      - Answer: We don't have to worry about this once we enable port forwarding
